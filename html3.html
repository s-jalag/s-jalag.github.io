       <h2> Unit 6 Motion</h2>
  
        <h2> Here are some key points that you will need to know to pass this unit</h2>
        
        <p>• Displacement is distance with direction.</p>
        
        <p>• Velocity is speed with direction.</p>
       
        <p>• Acceleration is how quickly velocity is changing.</p> 
         
        <p>•The equation for average velocity is v = d/t (d means displacement and t is time)</p>
        
        <p>• The equation for average speed is v = d/t (d means distance and t is time)</p>

	 <h2>Examples</h2>

        <p>Scooby and the gang are headed east in the mystery van. After 2 minutes (120 seconds), they have traveled 1680 meters. What is the vans average velocity? Use the seconds, and dont forget to include units. 
 
        <h3>Anwser</h3>
        <p>The anwser is 1680meters/120seconds = 14.
		Average velocity = 14m/s east.</p>
